Digital Scrum Poker built with meteor

This is a tool for distributed teams that want to play Scrum Poker to estimate user stories. It is especially useful to visualize the estimates of each team member in one digital place without the hazzle of always asking the remotes for their votes and explaining them the local estimates again and again.

## See in Action
